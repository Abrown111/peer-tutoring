    <p class="question">FAQs</p>

    <p class="question">Who can be a tutor?</p><br>

    <p class="faqAnswers">
    Anyone can become a peer tutor as long as they are confident in a chosen course’s material, have taken the class they want to tutor, and are willing to work with another peer!<br><br>
    </p>
      
    <p class="question">How much of a time commitment is being a tutor?</p><br>

    <p class="faqAnswers">
    Ultimately, it is up to the tutor to decide how often they are able to tutor. As a tutor, it is important to prioritize your own school work before meeting with your peers, and if you are unable to meet with your student, let them know ahead of time and cancel the appointment on Google Calendar. The student can either find another time to meet with the same tutor, or find another tutor on the main page. If you know you will not be available, then edit your calendar so that the time slot will no longer be available to book.<br><br>
    </p>
      
    <p class="question">How do I get a tutor?</p><br>

    <p class="faqAnswers">
    To get a tutor, go to the main page and look through the list of tutors to find one that tutors the subject you need help with. You can use the filters to find someone that tutors your specific subject. Then, click on their calendar link and sign up for a time that you are available. This process is completely confidential and the only people who will know who is receiving tutoring will be your individual tutor, Mrs. Ruff, and Jake. Anyone can sign up for peer tutoring, whether you just want to review some older topics or practice what you are currently learning!<br><br>
    </p>
      
    <p class="question">Are there benefits to being a tutor?</p><br>

    <p class="faqAnswers">
    As a caring community, we hope you become a tutor because you value your peers’ efforts to better themselves, but on top of the feeling you get from helping a friend, all time spent tutoring can be recorded as community service hours. Your hours will be tracked in a google spreadsheet every time you are booked as a tutor. However, you should still track your own hours in case any hours are missed.
