  <p class="question">Who can be a tutor?</p>

  <p class="faqAnswers">
    Anyone can become a peer tutor as long as they are confident in the chosen course’s material, have taken the class
    they want to tutor, and are willing to work with another peer!
  </p>

  <p class="question">How much of a time commitment is being a tutor?</p>

  <p class="faqAnswers">
    Ultimately, it is up to the tutor to decide how often they are able to tutor. As a tutor, it is important to
    prioritize your own school work before meeting with your peers, and if you are unable to meet with your student, let
    them know ahead of time and cancel the appointment on Google Calendar. The student can either find another time to
    meet with the same tutor, or find another tutor on the main page. If you know you will not be available, then edit
    your calendar so that the time slot will no longer be available to book.
  </p>

  <p class="question">How do I get a tutor?</p>

  <p class="faqAnswers">
    To get a tutor, go to the main page and look through the list of tutors to find one that tutors the subject you need
    help with. You can use the filters to find someone that tutors your specific subject. Then, click on their calendar
    link and sign up for a time that you are available. This process is completely confidential and the only people who
    will know who is receiving tutoring will be your individual tutor, Mrs. Ruff, and Jake. Anyone can sign up for peer
    tutoring, whether you just want to review some older topics or practice what you are currently learning!
  </p>

  <p class="question">Are there benefits to being a tutor?</p>

  <p class="faqAnswers">
    As a caring community, we hope you become a tutor because you value your peers’ efforts to better themselves, but on
    top of the feeling you get from helping a friend, all time spent tutoring can be recorded as community service
    hours. Your hours will be tracked in a google spreadsheet every time you are booked as a tutor. However, you should
    still track your own hours in case any hours are missed.
